# Automating Polici's Paperwork Processes
Filling out, sending over, and signing contracts are a lot of work. Let's automate it, instead.

## How it works
Clone the repo and edit the "ContractInfo" csv. Follow the demo fields closely. Make sure, after making required edits, that the file is saved as a csv and NOT an xlsx. Run the code and find all the filled out contracts in the "Ready" folder. 


```Name```  One's name. FIRST & LAST Required. eg "Henry Manley"
<br/>
```Address``` One's Address STREET ADDRESS Required. Put a dash where there would be line break. eg "123 Welcome Street - Ithaca, NY 14850"
<br/>
```Team``` Polici Team. Either "Tech", "Design", or "Business"
<br/>
```Email``` One's Email.
<br/>

<br/>
```End```Job end date. Required MM-DD-YY. eg "02/21/2022"
<br/>
